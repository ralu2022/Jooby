Structure of the project:
--------------------------
A. main classes
	- Applicant
	- Employer
	- JobListing
	- User

B. database classes
	- JdbcApplicantJobListing
	- JdbcApplicantRepository
	- JdbcEmployerRepository
	- JdbcJobListingEmployersRepository
	- JdbcJobListingRepository
	- JdbcUserRepository

C. jsp files
	- main pages;
	- user pages;

D. Testing
	-EmployerTest

Data structure used: 
-------------------

List<>;

Logic:
-------
The main purpose of how I approached the solution was to convey the idea that I understand the connection between Java language, databases and .jsp files. Reason is that in the future I would like to combine back-end with front-end, as I do not see myself working just on one of the both :)
